Network Intrusion Detection System using Snort 
Requirement:
.up-to-date virtual box
.Install Kali Linux(I recommended Debian flavour)
.up-to-date kali packages 
Command:
.sudo apt update && apt upgrade
Let's start making Intrusion Detection System

Step-by-Step guide

Step 1:
.install snort on Kali Linux
.sudo install snort
          or
You can intal snort from official websiteüëá
https:// www.snort.org
Step 2:
.Confirm installation by command 
.sudo snort --version
Step 3:
.To see all modules
.sudo snort -h (it will same as --help)
all modules like -c -v -e -d etc are shown.
Step 4:
Configuration:
.To configure the snort
.sudo -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
for manual Configuration/customized configuration:
commands:
.sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
sonrt.conf file will open)
Setup variables:
.ipvar HMOE_NET [IP address range]
.ipva EXTERNAL_NET $!HOME_NET
Step 5:
Configuration of rules:
.sudo /etc/snort/rules (all rules will be shown)
Setup rules:
.sudo mousepad /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
(writing pad will open to write rules)
Setup rules:
alert tcp HOME_NET [IP addressange] (msg:"  ";sid:1000001;)
.sid i should be unique 
.this is a basic network Detection rule 
.you can setup more rules like pass,drop and etc.
To find Network Interface:
.sudo ip a
.sudo ifconfig
Step 6:
Testing:
.Test your snort by following command 
.sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
congratsüéâ snort testing is validated üëç
Step7:
Monitoring:
this is last step os our Network Intrusion Detection System 
.sudo systemctl daemon-reload
.sudo systemctl enable snort
.sudo systemctl start snort
Now network snorting is start. You can configure logs b using commands
.sudo snort /var/log/log.txt
